## Chart Gallery - Django 1.8

This project is to showcase some interesting charting with data.

#### Environment Variables

* DJANGO_SECRET_KEY - The secret key that Django uses to lock down many of its security features. You shouldn't really ever need to type this in, so a long randomly generated string is in order.
